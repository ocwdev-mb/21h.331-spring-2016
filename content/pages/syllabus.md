## Course Description

Covering Ancient Rome from 133 to 27 BC, this course explores political, social, and economic factors commonly offered to explain the fall of the Roman Republic: growth of the territorial empire, increased intensity of aristocratic competition, transformation of the Italian economy, growth of the city of Rome and dependence of the urban plebs, changes in military recruitment, and dependence of soldiers on their generals. There is an emphasis on the reading of ancient sources in translation, including Cicero, Sallust, Caesar, Augustus, Appian, Plutarch, and Suetonius.

The WCC works with undergraduate and graduate students and with post-docs and faculty. The WCC helps you strategize about all types of academic and professional writing, as well as all aspects of oral presentations. No matter what department or discipline you are in, we help you think your way more deeply into your topic, help you see new implications in your data, research and ideas.

## Policy on Plagiarism

Plagiarism—the use of another's intellectual work without acknowledgement—is a serious offense.

Students who plagiarize will be liable to receive an F in the subject; and the case will be forwarded to the [Office of Student Citizenship](http://studentlife.mit.edu/osc). Full acknowledgement for all information obtained from sources outside the classroom must be clearly stated in all written work submitted and in all oral presentations, including images or texts in other media as well as materials collected online. All ideas, arguments, and direct phrasings taken from someone else's work must be identified and properly footnoted. Quotations from other sources must be clearly marked as distinct from the student's own work. For further guidance on the proper forms of attribution, consult the style guides available in the [Writing and Communication Center](http://cmsw.mit.edu/writing-and-communication-center/), and [Academic Integrity at MIT: A Handbook for Students](http://integrity.mit.edu/).

## Policy on Late Submission of Papers / Projects

Unexcused late submissions will incur a penalty of one partial grade step (e.g. from A- to B+) for each day late. Only serious and documented circumstances will be accepted as excuses (e.g. serious matters of health or other personal emergencies).
